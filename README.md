# Grocery Shop Management System

Developed a full-featured management system to digitize grocery store operations, focusing on inventory control, sales tracking, billing, and customer management. The system allows store managers to add, update, and delete products, process sales and returns, and automatically update stock in real time. It also generates invoices, sales reports, and low-stock alerts to support decision-making. Role-based access control and encrypted login ensure data security. Designed with scalability in mind, the system improves operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability by reducing manual workload and enabling data-driven insights.
